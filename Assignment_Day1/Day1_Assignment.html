<font size=4>
    <p>There’s an automatic association between AI and sci-fi. When people think of artificial intelligence, they tend to think of the Terminator, Data from Star Trek, HAL from 2001, etc. These represent a very specific form of AI known as Artificial General Intelligence (also known as Strong AI) – a digital form of consciousness that can match or exceed human-like performance in any number of metrics. An AGI would be equally good at solving math equations, conducting a humanlike conversation, or composing a sonnet.
